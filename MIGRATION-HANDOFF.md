# integration implementation handoff

## Migration/implementation summary

Refuse empty-object required-field bypasses, nonfinite or malformed values and contradictory schemas; expose explicit registry composition. [PR #5](https://github.com/kumwe/integration/pull/5) contains this successor. The changelog version describes the proposed artifact; it is not a publication observation.

## Public API and responsibility

Event contracts, schema validation and portable integration declarations are implemented and tested here. Transport, outbox persistence, commit ordering, network deadlines and final authorization remain host responsibilities. Every exported member is recorded in resources/public-api/v1.json and documented in docs/public-api.md. The current surface contains 35 types. 33 types have recorded extraction provenance; package-native composition is identified separately.

## Capability reuse/semantic input review

The implementation consumes the exact canonical dependency contracts recorded in composer.json. Install the exact independently verified successor; run Composer resolution, archive consumer gates and affected App integration tests before namespace removal. Published Automation 0.1.0 requires Contribution 0.1.0 and Access Context 0.1.0. Publish a compatible Automation successor first, then promote Integration Automation/Contribution/Access Context pins together. The current coherent release graph remains pinned.

## Consumer inventory

The machine record lists actual source mappings, known consumer paths and concrete namespace replacements. resources/migration/consumer-inventory.json and resources/migration/source-map.json retain source digests where present. Dynamic references and same-namespace names must be searched again during adoption; the inventory does not imply that App has already switched ownership.

## Test ownership

Package tests own portable values, validation, service behavior, explicit construction and malformed-input regressions. The machine record identifies the source suites to split. Host persistence, transactions, authority, transport and operational integration stay in App. After verified adoption, remove duplicate library implementation assertions from App together with their legacy source.

## Next-task execution notes

Independent successor release verification and the final package gate remain necessary before App adoption. Integration cannot use Contribution 0.1.1 or Access Context 0.1.1 until the compatible Automation successor is actually published. Install the exact independently verified successor; run Composer resolution, archive consumer gates and affected App integration tests before namespace removal. Published Automation 0.1.0 requires Contribution 0.1.0 and Access Context 0.1.0. Publish a compatible Automation successor first, then promote Integration Automation/Contribution/Access Context pins together. The current coherent release graph remains pinned. Run final source and clean archive gates before admitting the package; then update the App dependency lock, replace namespaces, retain host adapters and remove only the inventoried portable legacy implementations.

## Drift check

Reconcile the recorded source commit and per-file source digests with the current App before adoption. Recompute all public manifest hashes together. Keep actual release observations and final tested commit identities outside the tested source tree to avoid self-referential evidence.

## Validation recipe and observed local results

Run composer check with the documented PHP runtime and extensions. The review added and exercised the boundary regressions described in CHANGELOG.md. A final gate pass, remote CI status and immutable release verification are distinct observations; neither a proposed version nor this handoff attests publication. See docs/integration.md and the package check scripts for the exact archive and runtime recipe.
